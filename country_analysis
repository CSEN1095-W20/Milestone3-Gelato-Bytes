It is expected that the average score of Finland to be much higher than afghanistan according to the data from our previous notebook in MS 1& 2 however this did not happen in this case ,We can suppose the results from this sample came this way as 80 tweets is a very low number  and the time span of 4 days is very short (could be some incident in these 4 days) or maybe the finland tweeps tend to write negative tweets, with such numbers we can not hold them reliable or accountable as a representative to the truth in this case.
